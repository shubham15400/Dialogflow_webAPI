# Project Name: Flask-Dialogflow Integration with Render

## Description
This project integrates a Flask application with Dialogflow using Render as a web service API. The integration allows for seamless conversational AI interactions, providing users with intelligent responses based on Dialogflow's natural language processing capabilities. The Flask app acts as a backend for processing and handling requests and responses between Dialogflow and the user interface.
